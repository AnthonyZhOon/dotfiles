I've claimed this, but noticed 2 existing styles for documenting complexity in the collections docs, hashset uses a heading  `# performance` once while linked_list just writes it inline when complexity exists. 
Also there's an existing `# performance` in the collections doc https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/index.html#performance which has tables for the complexity of all collections, so
